# Title:
## PayPer - Installments Tracker

# Description:
This is **PayPer**! An ultra-low memory footprint web-app solution catered towards small/medium sized businesses for managing and keeping tabs on installment payments owed by clients.

# Motivation:
There are a lot of ways to keep tabs on monthly owing clients but none of them notify the business owner/finance department on an upcoming payment in real-time while utilizing little device memory. **PayPer** is the business client management tool you need for working on low-memory devices like Raspberry Pis, android tablets and iPads (smartphone responsive version is in the works). We own a family-owned car sale business and required web-app solution such as **PayPer** only to find none (most needed downloads and monthly subscriptions). So I took began working on this project.
